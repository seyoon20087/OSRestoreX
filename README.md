# OSRestoreX and Terminal
A semi-restore Alternative for Jailbroken iOS devices.

You can build OSRestoreX yourself or use the Mac version via SSH.


## DISCLAIMER:

This tool is not tested by me. Please use with caution.

### WARNING:
You MUST have a computer with SSH support (we recommend a Mac or a PC with Ubuntu). For restoring your device you MUST have a Windows PC or a Mac.
 - If you're using macOS Mojave or earlier, or using a Windows PC, you MUST download and install iTunes, which is free to [download](https://apple.com/itunes).
 - If you're using macOS Catalina or later, you can use Finder to do so.
 - You will use recovery/DFU mode to restore your device. When you see your device on Finder or iTunes, you should select "Restore" on the prompt. (If you already have an IPSW software downloaded, click "Cancel" on the prompt, and use Option+Restore for Mac, or Shift+Restore if you're using Windows, select IPSW file, and click "Restore" again to confirm.)
<!-- - If you do NOT have access to SSH key you can find the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) (while skipping "add the SSH key to your GitHub account" part). -->
